I'd like to thank my advisor, Carl Edward Rasmussen.  It was wonderful having an advisor who had spent many years thinking deeply about the business of modeling. ``The devil is in the details''.
I'd also like to thank Zoubin Ghahramani for providing much encouragement.

Thanks to Michael Osborne, whose thesis was an inspiration.  Discussions with Roman Garnett made the research process enjoyable.
Sinead Williamson and Peter Orbanz provided valuable advice in my early years in the lab.
Philipp Hennig mentored me during my time in T\"{u}bingen.

I'd like to thank Andrew McHutchon, Konstantina Palla, Alex Davies and Neil Houlsby for making the lab feel like a family.
I'd like to thank James Lloyd for all the endless discussions that really helped refine my understanding of a lot of things, and for keeping a level head even in the depths of deadline death-marches.
Christian Steinruecken constantly reminded me that amazing things are hidden all around.
