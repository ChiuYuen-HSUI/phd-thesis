I'd like to thank my supervisor, Carl Rasmussen, for so much advice and encouragement.
It was wonderful working with someone who had spent many years thinking deeply about the business of modeling, who also allowed me the freedom to make my own mistakes.
I'd also like to thank my advisor, Zoubin Ghahramani, for providing much encouragement and support.

Thanks to Michael Osborne, whose thesis was an inspiration, and to Roman Garnett for making research fun.
Sinead Williamson and Peter Orbanz provided valuable advice early on.
Philipp Hennig was a mentor to me during my time in T\"{u}bingen, and demonstrated an inspiring level of German effectiveness.  Who else finishes their conference papers with entire days to spare?

I'd like to thank Andrew McHutchon, Konstantina Palla, Alex Davies and Neil Houlsby for making the lab feel like a family.
I'd like to thank James Lloyd for the many endless discussions, and for keeping a level head even during the depths of deadline death-marches.

Roger Grosse demonstrated the power of deeply understanding the basics, and how much we still don't know about simple things.
Josh Tenenbaum's infectious enthusiasm and broad perspective made every project much more rewarding.
Christian Steinruecken constantly reminded me that amazing things are hidden all around.

My graduate study was supported by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, The Cambridge Commonwealth Trust, Pembroke College, and a grant from Google.
