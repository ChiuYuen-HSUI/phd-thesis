First, I would like to thank my supervisor, Carl Rasmussen, for so much advice and encouragement.
It was wonderful working with someone who had spent many years thinking deeply about the business of modeling.
Carl was patient while I spent the first few months of my PhD chasing various ideas, and then gently suggested a series of ideas which actually worked.

I'd also like to thank my advisor, Zoubin Ghahramani, for providing much encouragement, support, and advice.
The lab was also constantly populated with interesting visitors, thanks mainly to Zoubin.

Thanks to Michael Osborne, whose thesis was an inspiration early on, and to Roman Garnett for being a sane third party.
Sinead Williamson, Peter Orbanz and John Cunningham provided valuable advice when I was still overwhelmed and bewildered.
Ferenc Huszar and David Knowles made it clear that constantly asking questions was the right way to go.

Tom Dean and Greg Corrado really made me feel at home at Google.
Philipp Hennig was a mentor to me during my time in T\"{u}bingen, and demonstrated an inspiring level of German effectiveness.
Who else finishes their conference papers with entire days to spare?
I'd also like to thank Ryan Adams for hosting me during my visit to Harvard, and for building such an awesome group.
Josh Tenenbaum's infectious enthusiasm and broad perspective made the projects we worked on much more rewarding.
The time I got to spend with Roger Grosse was mind-expanding -- he constantly suprised me by pointing out basic unsolved questions aboutt decades-old methods, and had extremely high standards for his own work.

I'd like to thank Andrew McHutchon, Konstantina Palla, Alex Davies and Neil Houlsby for making the lab feel like a family.
I'd like to thank James Lloyd for the many endless discussions, and for keeping a level head even during the depths of deadline death-marches.
Christian Steinruecken constantly reminded me that amazing things are hidden all around.

My graduate study was supported by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust, Pembroke College, and a grant from Google.
