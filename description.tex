\chapter{Automatically Describing Structured Covariance Functions}
\label{ch:description}





%This paper presents the beginnings of an automatic statistician, focusing on regression problems.
%Our system explores an open-ended space of possible statistical models to discover a good explanation of the data, and then produces a detailed report with figures and natural-language text.

%Our approach treats unknown functions nonparametrically using Gaussian processes, which has two important consequences.
%First, Gaussian processes model functions in terms of high-level properties (e.g.\ smoothness, trends, periodicity,
%changepoints).
%Taken together with the compositional structure of our language of models, this allows us to automatically describe functions through a decomposition into additive parts.
%Second, the use of flexible nonparametric models and a rich
%language for composing them in an open-ended manner also results
%in state-of-the-art extrapolation performance evaluated over 13 real time
%series data sets from various domains.

%\section{Automatic description of regression models}
%\label{sec:description}

%\paragraph{Overview}

The compositional structure of the language allows us to develop a method for automatically translating components of the model into natural-language descriptions of patterns in the data.
In this chapter, we describe how \procedurename{} generates natural-language descriptions of the models found by the search procedure.
We also show examples of automatically generated reports which highlight interpretable features discovered in a variety of data sets (e.g.\ figure~\ref{fig:periodic}).

\section{Building Noun Phrases}

There are two main features of our language of \gp{} models that allow description to be performed automatically.
First, the sometimes complicated kernel expressions found can be simplified into a sum of products.
A sum of kernels corresponds to a sum of functions so each product can be described separately.
Second, each kernel in a product modifies the resulting model in a consistent way.
Therefore, we can choose one kernel to be described as a noun, with all others described using adjectives.


\subsubsection{Simplification Rules}
We convert each kernel expression into a standard, simplified form.
We do this by first distributing all products of sums into a sum of products.
Next, we apply several simplifications to the kernel expression:
The product of two $\kSE$ kernels is another $\kSE$ with different parameters. Multiplying $\kWN$ by any stationary kernel ($\kC$, $\kWN$, $\kSE$, or $\kPer$) gives another $\kWN$ kernel. Multiplying any kernel by $\kC$ only changes the parameters of the original kernel.

After applying these rules, the kernel can as be written as a sum of terms of the form:
\begin{align}
K \prod_m \kLin^{(m)} \prod_n \boldsymbol\sigma^{(n)},
\label{eq:sop}
\end{align}
where $K$ is one of \kWN, \kC, \kSE, $\prod_k \kPer^{(k)}$ or $\kSE \prod_k \kPer^{(k)}$
and $\prod_i\kernel^{(i)}$ denotes a product of kernels, each with different parameters.


%\subsubsection{Sums of kernels are sums of functions}
%Formally, if $f_1(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel_1)$ and independently $f_2(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel_2)$ then ${f_1(x) + f_2(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel_1 + \kernel_2)}$.
Because sums of kernels correspond to sums of functions, we can describe each product of kernels separately.


\subsubsection{Each kernel in a product modifies a model in a consistent way}
This allows us to describe the contribution of each kernel in a product as an adjective, or more generally as a modifier of a noun.
We now describe how each kernel modifies a model and how this can be described in natural language:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Multiplication by $\kSE$} removes long range correlations from a model since $\kSE(x,x')$ decreases monotonically to 0 as $|x - x'|$ increases.
This can be described as making an existing model's correlation structure `local' or `approximate'.
\item {\bf Multiplication by $\kLin$} is equivalent to multiplying the function being modeled by a linear function.
If $f(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel)$, then $xf(x) \dist \gp{}\left(0, k \times \kLin \right)$.
This causes the standard deviation of the model to vary linearly without affecting the correlation and can be described as \eg `with linearly increasing standard deviation'.
\item {\bf Multiplication by $\boldsymbol\sigma$} is equivalent to multiplying the function being modeled by a sigmoid which means that the function goes to zero before or after some point.
This can be described as \eg `from [time]' or `until [time]'.
\item {\bf Multiplication by $\kPer$}
modifies the correlation structure in the same way as multiplying the function by an independent periodic function.
Formally, if ${f_1(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel_1)}$ and ${f_2(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel_2)}$ then
\begin{align}
{\textrm{Cov} \left[f_1(x)f_2(x), f_1(x')f_2(x') \right] = k_1(x,x')k_2(x,x')}.\nonumber
\end{align}
This can be loosely described as \eg `modulated by a periodic function with a period of [period] [units]'.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Constructing a complete description of a product of kernels}
We choose one kernel to act as a noun which is then described by the functions it encodes for when unmodified \eg `smooth function' for $\kSE$.
Modifiers corresponding to the other kernels in the product are then appended to this description, forming a noun phrase of the form:
\begin{align*}
\textnormal{Determiner}	+	\textnormal{Premodifiers} +	\textnormal{Noun}	+	\textnormal{Postmodifiers}
\end{align*}

As an example, a kernel of the form $\kSE \times \kPer \times  \kLin \times \boldsymbol{\sigma}$ could be described as an
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{\kSE}_{\textnormal{\scriptsize approximately}} \times 
\underbrace{\kPer}_{\textnormal{\scriptsize periodic function}} \times 
\underbrace{\kLin}_{\textnormal{\scriptsize with linearly growing amplitude}} \times 
\underbrace{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{\textnormal{\scriptsize until 1700.}}
\end{align*}
where $\kPer$ has been selected as the head noun.

In principle, any assignment of kernels in a product to these different phrasal roles is possible, but in practice we found certain assignments to produce more interpretable phrases than others.
The head noun is chosen according to the following ordering:
\begin{align*}
\kPer > \kWN, \kSE, \kC > \prod_m \kLin^{(m)} > \prod_n \boldsymbol\sigma^{(n)}
\end{align*}
\ie $\kPer$ is always chosen as the head noun when present.

\paragraph{Ordering additive components}

The reports generated by \procedurename{} attempt to present the most interesting or important features of a data set first.
As a heuristic, we order components by always adding next the component which most reduces the 10-fold cross-validated mean absolute error.



\subsection{Worked Example}

Suppose we start with a kernel of the form
\begin{align*}
\kSE \times (\kWN \times \kLin + \kCP(\kC, \kPer)).
\end{align*}
This is converted to a sum of products:
\begin{align*}
\kSE \times \kWN \times \kLin + \kSE \times \kC \times \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \kSE \times \kPer \times \boldsymbol{\bar\sigma}.
\end{align*}
which is simplified to
\begin{align*}
\kWN \times \kLin + \kSE \times \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \kSE \times \kPer \times \boldsymbol{\bar\sigma}.
\end{align*}

To describe the first component, the head noun description for $\kWN$, `uncorrelated noise', is concatenated with a modifier for $\kLin$, `with linearly increasing standard deviation'.
%
The second component is described as `A smooth function with a lengthscale of [lengthscale] [units]', corresponding to the $\kSE$, `which applies until [changepoint]', which corresponds to the $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$.
%
Finally, the third component is described as `An approximately periodic function with a period of [period] [units] which applies from [changepoint]'.

%Descriptions are sometimes modified depending on kernel parameters.  
%Also, a separate description procedure is used to produce the detailed descriptions of each component, which operates on the same principles.

%\fTBD{JL: We should also mention that the detailed descriptions are less modular - but not necessarily so}
%\fTBD{JL: Talk about different templates based on parameters?}








%Automating the process of statistical modeling would have a tremendous impact on fields that currently rely on expert statisticians, machine learning researchers, and data scientists.
%While fitting simple models (such as linear regression) is largely automated by standard software packages, there has been little work on the automatic construction of flexible but interpretable models. 
%What are the ingredients required for an artificial intelligence system to be able to perform statistical modeling automatically? 
%In this paper we conjecture that the following ingredients may be useful for building an AI system for statistics, and we develop a working system which incorporates them:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item {\bf An open-ended language of models} expressive enough to
%  capture many of the modeling assumptions and model composition
%  techniques  applied by human statisticians to capture real-world phenomena
%\item {\bf A search procedure} to efficiently explore the space of
%  models spanned by the language
%\item {\bf A principled method for evaluating models} in terms of their complexity and their degree of fit to the
%  data
%\item {\bf A procedure for automatically generating reports} which
%  explain and visualize different factors underlying the data, make
%  the chosen modeling assumptions explicit, and quantify how each
%  component improves the predictive power of the model 
%\end{itemize}




%The supplementary material to this paper includes 13 complete reports automatically generated by \procedurename{}.

%Good statistical modeling requires not only
%interpretability but predictive accuracy.





%\subsection{Airline passenger data}

%Figure \ref{fig:airline_decomp} shows the decomposition produced by applying our method to monthly totals of international airline passengers~\citep{box2011time}.
%We observe similar components to the previous dataset: a long term trend, annual periodicity and medium-term deviations.
%In addition, the composite kernel captures the near-linearity of the long-term trend, and the linearly growing amplitude of the annual oscillations.
%The discovery of linear structure allows for a growing uncertainty highly plausible extrapolation.\fTBD{Mention heteroskedasticity?}

%Discovering this linearity results in very plausible extrapolations of the data.
%Figure~\ref{fig:airline_grow} demonstrates this by ploting the full posterior of the kernel discovered at sequential levels of the search.
%The first plot shows that the first kernel has discovered onyl short term continuity.
%The second kernel discovers periodicity that varies with time.
%The third kernel has discovered that the periodicity is growing approximately linearly.
%Finally, the fourth kernel has split the data into an approximately linear trend and growing oscillations.

%To evaluate the effectiveness of our method we performed two types of experiments.
%First, we examined the ability of our algorithm to discover useful structure in one-dimensional datasets.  Second, we examined the predictive performance of our model on multi-dimensional datasets.
% testing the ability of the algorithm to infer both an accurate regression function estimate and to produce an interpretable decomposition of a regression function.
%The accuracy experiments show that our method consistently matches or beats previous state of the art regression methods (\TBD{not yet statistically significantly within each experiment - more experiments currently running\ldots}).
%The decomposition experiments produce highly interpretable decompositions of time series data and highly plausible extrapolations; a particularly rare property of naively applied (linear) smoothers (\TBD{justify comment - e.g.~local linear is just linear, GP Sq-Exp nose dives towards the mean}).

%\paragraph{Multidimensional decomposition}  Decomposition of multi-dimensional posteriors into sums of one-dimensional functions is possible as well, and was demonstrated in \cite{duvenaud2011additive11}.  \fTBD{Probably citing myself too much...}






We demonstrate the ability of our procedure to discover and describe a variety of patterns on two time series.
%Full automatically-generated reports for 13 data sets are provided as supplementary material.




\section{Example: Summarizing 400 Years of Solar Activity}
\label{sec:solar}


We show excerpts from the report automatically generated on annual solar irradiation data from 1610 to 2011 (figure~\ref{fig:solar}).

\label{fig:solar}
\end{figure}
%
This time series has two pertinent features: a roughly 11-year cycle of solar activity, and a period lasting from 1645 to 1715 with much smaller variance than the rest of the dataset.
This flat region corresponds to the Maunder minimum, a period in which sunspots were extremely rare \citep{lean1995reconstruction}.
\procedurename{} clearly identifies these two features, as discussed below.

Figure \ref{fig:exec} shows the natural-language summaries of the top four components chosen by \procedurename{}.
From these short summaries, we can see that our system has identified the Maunder minimum (second component) and 11-year solar cycle (fourth component).
These components are visualized in figures~\ref{fig:maunder} and \ref{fig:periodic}, respectively. 
The third component corresponds to long-term trends, as visualized in figure~\ref{fig:smooth}.

\end{figure}

Next, we present the analysis generated by our procedure on international airline passenger data (figure~\ref{fig:airline}).
The model constructed by \procedurename{} has four components: $\kLin + \kSE \times \kPer \times \kLin + \kSE + \kWN \times \kLin$, with descriptions given in figure~\ref{fig:exec-airline}.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:description-related-work}


%\subsection{Natural-language output}
To the best of our knowledge, our procedure is the first example of automatic description of nonparametric statistical models.
However, systems with natural language output have been built in the areas of video interpretation \citep{barbu2012video} and automated theorem proving \citep{GanesalingamG13}.




\section{Conclusion}
Towards the goal of automating statistical modeling we have presented a system which constructs an appropriate model from an open-ended language and automatically generates detailed reports that describe patterns in the data captured by the model.
We have demonstrated that our procedure can discover and describe a variety of patterns on several time series.
We believe this procedure has the potential to make powerful statistical model-building techniques accessible to non-experts.
